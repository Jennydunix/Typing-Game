# Typing-Game

 This game is going to test a player's typing skill, which is one of the most underrated skills all developers should have.
 The general flow of the game will look like this:
+ Player clicks on start button and is presented with a quote to type
+ Player types the quote as quickly as they can in a textbox
+ As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted
+ If the player has a typo, the textbox is updated to red
+ When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time
